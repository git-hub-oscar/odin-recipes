I did not write or create any of these recipes or images. They are only used for an assignment for The Odin Project. 

You can find the original recipes here:

Assignment#1, HTML
Project assignment from The Odin Project by git-hub-oscar.
This project has been a good learning experience with using html elements and using links. I've done it before but it was a good reminder. The biggest thing it helped me learn was using git for a project.

Assignment#2, CSS
This was a very good reminder to how css works. I'm not completely happy with how it looks at the moment but I'm sure I'll be able to come back to revisit the project again. Learning about cascade in css was very helpful.
